    Effective Time Management – Prioritize tasks and set realistic deadlines.
    Regular Progress Tracking – Monitor updates through stand-up meetings and tools like Jira or Trello.
    Identify & Mitigate Risks – Address potential delays early.
    Encourage Team Collaboration – Promote communication and accountability.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Importance of Cost Control in Software Projects

    Prevents budget overruns and financial losses.
    Ensures efficient resource allocation.
    Keeps the project on track and profitable.

Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns

    Accurate Cost Estimation – Plan budgets based on realistic projections.
    Prioritize Features – Focus on essential functionalities first.
    Use Agile Methodologies – Adapt to changes without unnecessary spending.
    Monitor Expenses Regularly – Track costs using project management tools.
    Avoid Scope Creep – Stick to defined project requirements.
    Optimize Resource Utilization – Assign tasks efficiently to reduce waste.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile
 Advantages:

    Flexible and adaptable to changes.
    Continuous feedback improves product quality.
    Faster delivery with incremental releases.
 Disadvantages:

    Requires constant collaboration and discipline.
    Hard to estimate time and cost upfront.
    Not ideal for projects with fixed requirements.

Waterfall

Advantages:

    Clear structure with well-defined stages.
    Easier to estimate time and budget.
    Best for projects with stable requirements.

Disadvantages:

    Rigid and difficult to adapt to changes.
    Late-stage issues are costly to fix.
    Testing happens at the end, increasing risks.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is Best For:

    Dynamic, fast-changing projects requiring flexibility.
    Software development startups releasing frequent updates.
    Customer-focused applications needing continuous feedback.

Example:
Developing a mobile app with evolving user requirements.
Waterfall is Best For:

    Fixed-scope projects with clear, unchanging requirements.
    Highly regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance).
    Hardware development where changes are costly.

Example:
Building a banking system that must meet strict security regulations.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance

    Code Reviews – Catch errors early through peer reviews.
    Automated Testing – Run tests consistently to detect bugs.
    Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) – Ensure smooth updates.
    User Testing – Gather feedback to improve usability.
    Clear Documentation – Maintain consistency and best practices.
Importance of High Standards

    Prevents costly bugs and rework.
    Enhances user satisfaction and trust.
    Ensures reliability and security.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Importance of Defining Project Scope

    Prevents scope creep and uncontrolled changes.
    Ensures clear objectives and deliverables.
    Helps in resource allocation and budgeting.
    Improves team alignment and stakeholder expectations.
    What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?

    A WBS breaks a project into smaller, manageable tasks in a hierarchical format.
    Why is WBS Useful?

    Provides clear structure and task ownership.
    Improves time and cost estimation.
    Enhances team coordination and tracking.

    Defining scope and using WBS ensure smooth project execution.
